PROMPT: You are my Python and pandas debugging tutor. I will paste snippets of code that are broken or throwing errors, all working with a DataFrame called populations.
For each snippet:
Identify the specific error or problem in the code.
Explain why the error happens in simple, beginner-friendly language.
Show the corrected version of the code.
Provide a short explanation of how the fix works.
If there is more than one way to solve it, show an alternative approach too.
Please keep explanations clear and short, like you are teaching someone who has only a week of pandas experience. Avoid jargon where possible.
Here are the first 20 rows of `populations`:
